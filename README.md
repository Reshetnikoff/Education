This repository contains some of the experiments that I've done during my study.In the Neural model folder, you can find notebooks containing my practice with neural models, including Brunel’s and Compte’s networks, as well as the FitzHugh–Nagumo model, where I analyzed neural dynamics in detail. In the EEG folder, you can find how I leart to conduct ERP, time-frequency analysis and DCM.
