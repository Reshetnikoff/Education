Here, my experiments with neural computational models are present:

1. Brunel's network is a fundamental work that allows me to learn how neural populations behave. I show here all activities: fast and slow synchronous irregular state, asynchronous irregular state and synchronous regular state. For all, I calculated CV, power spectrum and theoretical and experimental stationary firing rate where it's acceptable, and leave some comments. I used the model from the Neural Dynamics exercise (https://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exercises/brunel-network.html) because it has really good plots. However, here, I created my own networks based on the Brian2 package at the end.

2. Compte's model of working memory which I'm fascinated. There, two experiments are present. Firstly, I partially reproduce the result of the bump attractor drift depending on the number of neurons in the population. And secondly, I explored how the shape of the bump changes among schizophrenia patients. It refers to the work Murray D. et al, 2014 which I too really like

3. The Decision Making notebook explores the **perceptual decision-making model** by Wong & Wang, which investigates how the brain makes choices when faced with two competing hypotheses. The focus is on solving the related neuronal dynamics exercises ([exercise link](https://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exercises/perceptual-decision-making.html)). In particular, I examined how varying input influences decision outcomes.

4. The phase plane notebook focuses on the FitzHughâ€“Nagumo model. In it, I analyze the neural dynamics by identifying when saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations occur, using a combination of numerical experiments and mathematical calculations.
