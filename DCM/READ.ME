This part describes a toy example of dynamic causal modeling processing using ERP EEG data  This code refers to the [workshop](https://github.com/AshleyTyrer/DCM_for_ERPs) which Ashley Tyrer held within the [Computational Psychiatry Course](https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/) in 2023

Ashlye's [work](https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/2/2/fcaa212/6029493) explored changes in the brain connectivity during visual recognition and implicit priming tasks between control and Parkinson's disease patients. Based on the source reconstruction, the model with four sources are created which are used further in the DCM experiment. 
At the seminar, she explored how to conduct DCM and how to analyse the obtained data in the SPM taking as an example the preprocessed EEG sample of one patient.
